Django Solr Documentation
=========================

Introduction
============
The purpose of this project is to allow developers to quickly integrate Solr search with any Django application. 
It was originally built for the `The Washington Times <http://www.washingtontimes.com>`_ on Django .91 and has been upgraded to function with Django 1.0. 
During that process I broke a lot of things, but also made it a lot enhancements. We've tried to document the code 
to the best of our ability, outlining features and :ref:`things <fixme>` that could be improved. Don't expect perfection. 
Expect a great starting point that needs to be improved and nurtured. 

We are always looking for ways to improve this project, so for questions or suggestions you can use one of the following tools.

* Log issues in the `Google Code Project <http://code.google.com/p/django-solr-search/issues/list>`_. 
* Ask questions to the `Google Group <http://groups.google.com/group/django-solr>`_. (overkill?)
* Find us on the #django irc channel. Our nicks are `screeley` and `jdolan`.
* `Contact <http://www.screeley.com/contact/>`_ me directly.
