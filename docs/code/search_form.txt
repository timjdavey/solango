Search Form
===========

The `solango` search form is very simple on purpose but it's very easily extended. it 
looks like so::

    class SearchForm(forms.Form):
        q = forms.CharField(required=False)
    
        def clean_q(self):
            q = self.cleaned_data.get("q")
	        if not q:
	            raise forms.ValidationError("You cannot query for an empty string")
	        return q

This is nice, but an advanced search form would be much more useful. One isn't included
with `solango` because there is no one way to do it. So here's an example of adding
an `advanced search form <http://yml-blog.blogspot.com/2009/02/django-full-text-search-with-solango_21.html>`_
at Yann Malet's Blog. I'm waiting for him to write something up for the docs. :)
